<p>This tool was built on a Spring MVC backend with an Angular driven UI. It interacts with
    <a href="http://restcountries.eu/">http://restcountries.eu/</a> to get the data for its reports, caching the data with a
    configurable (via properties file) refresh period.</p>
<p>The Spring implementation utilizes 100% <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-javaconfig/docs/1.0.0.M4/reference/html/">Java Config</a>.
    This was chosen over an XML implementation for two reasons: 1) it eliminates a layer of abstraction unnecessary for
    this project, 2) The last service I created utilized Java Config.</p>
<p>The implementation of the Query interface utilizes an in-memory cache with synchronization. If the performance of
    the system suffered too greatly on the hold-pattern of the cache, it could be resolved by increasing the cache duration,
    by allowing the system to return the old cache version while it's being refreshed, or switching to a scheduled refresh.</p>
<p>Additionally, both the UI and the Server-side Service utilize an extensible paradigm. The Server-side uses Reflection
    to limit the amount of code necessary to query the List-based fields, and the UI makes use of the RESTful URL structure
    by centralizing the actual $html calls and passing in fields. Querying against any of the other List-based statistics
    would be (and was, after I wrote the first) straight forward.</p>
<p>For testing, the backend utilizes JUnit with Mockito and PowerMock. Front-end testing was intended to be done via
    Jasmine, but all solutions I have implemented previously did not use JSP/Controllers to serve up static resources,
    and all examples I found for Jasmine testing with this framework relied on
    <a href="https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-security-and-angular-js/">Spring Boot and extensive modifications
    to the framework to use</a>. In the end, for the purpose of this service, I opted to omit full UI-testing and focused
    on the Service.</p>
